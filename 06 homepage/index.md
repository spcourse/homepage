## Requirements

Alright, now it's time to make your website your own. Design a personal webpage
about yourself, one of your interests, or any other topic of your choice. The
subject matter, look and feel, and design of the site are entirely up to you,
subject to the following requirements:

- Your website must contain at least four different `.html` pages, and it
  should be possible to get from any page on your website to any other page by
  following one or more hyperlinks.
- Your website must include at least one list (ordered or unordered), at least
  one table, and at least one image.
- Your website must have at least one stylesheet file.
- Your stylesheet(s) must use at least five different CSS properties, and at
  least five different types of CSS selectors. You must use the `#id` selector
  at least once, and the `.class` selector at least once.
- Images may not be larger than 1MB.

## Tips

- You can view your webpages offline by opening the `.html` files with your web browser.
