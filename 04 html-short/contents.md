_Note that, in the video above, Doug shows how to preview the HTML document in an online IDE. As we will be working on our own computers, we can just double click a html file to open it in our standard browser and preview it!_

Where HTML is the language we use to express the content of a website, its design is largely determined by Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). CSS can be used to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, or add animations and other decorative features.

A webpage is a document. This document can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. The Document Object Model (DOM) represents that same document so it can be manipulated. The DOM is an object-oriented representation of the webpage and can be used as a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.
